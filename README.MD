# Hangman

## Overview

Hangman is a classic game where the goal is to guess all of
the letters of a randomly generated word, each letter
represented by a blank space "\_". For each incorrect guess,
one element of a hanged stick figure is drawn. The game is
lost if all elements of the stick figure are drawn before
the word is guessed.
